# Horiseon Website Optimization

## Description

The Horiseon Website Optimization Project encompasses a comprehensive overhaul and enhancement of the existing Horiseon website, focusing on the refinement and optimization of both its HTML and CSS code. The primary objectives of this project are to significantly improve website accessibility and bolster its performance in the realm of Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

The pre-existing website exhibited a substantial degree of code redundancy and failed to adhere to the principles of semantic HTML coding. This project was undertaken to address these deficiencies comprehensively. It involved a meticulous reevaluation and rewriting of the entire website's codebase, conforming to the highest standards of semantic HTML markup.

This project not only contributed to the optimization of the Horiseon website but also provided invaluable learning experiences. It deepened my understanding of semantic HTML, the principles of website accessibility, and the strategic application of code reusability in the context of enhancing web-based platforms.

The following screenshots provide a basic idea of how the project restructured the HTML layout of the website by using proper semantic HTML elements.
